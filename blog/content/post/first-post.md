I decided over the holidays that I'd like to learn more about [hugo][1] and
figured that using hugo to add a blog to my site would be a good way to
learn *and* give me a place to blog.

I started with the hugo documentation and wanted to start building a new
hugo theme from scratch. I found [this tutorial on creating a new theme][2]
to be useful.
