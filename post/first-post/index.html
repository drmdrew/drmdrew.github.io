            <p>I decided over the holidays that I&rsquo;d like to learn more about <a href="https://gohugo.io">hugo</a> and
figured that using hugo to add a blog to my site would be a good way to
learn <em>and</em> give me a place to blog.</p>

<p>I started with the hugo documentation and wanted to start building a new
hugo theme from scratch. I found <a href="http://themes.gohugo.io/theme/hugo-theme-foundation6-blog/2014/09/creating-a-new-theme/">this tutorial on creating a new theme</a>
to be useful.</p>
